Nice work, Steve!

An article on cubics is included in the ISOPTIKON geometry program.
You know it, don't you? (an excerpt follows for those who haven't seen it)

Apollonian (isoptic) cubics> An application of group  theory to Euclidean
geometry
                  By Paris Pamfilos and Apostolos Thoma


1.        Introduction

1.0   The Apollonian circle c of two segments BA, AC on the same line e
(figure-1) , is the locus of points P of the plane for which the ratio

|PB|/|PC| = |BA|/|AC|.

It is easily seen that for all P on c the line PA bissects the angle �BPC.
Thus the Apollonian circle is, at the same time, part of the locus of points
P viewing the segments BA and AC under equal angles.

Considering more general positions for the segments AB, AC we arrive at
the problem formulated  by Jacob Steiner in 1852 :

1.1   Problem :  Given two line segments AB and CD on the same plane, find
the locus of points P having the property : the angles viewing AB and CD
from P, are equal (or supplementary)  �APB = �CPD (figure-2) .

Apparently Steiner was not aware of the work of Van Rees  who, in 1829,
studied, in another context, a family of cubic curves solving this problem.
In fact it is easily seen (Steiner) that the locus of points P with the above
property is described by a pair of cubics passing  through the points A, B,
C, D (figure-3) .

It was Gomes Teixeira in 1915 , who remarked that these cubics are precisely
the curves studied by Van Rees in their normal (or canonical) form

1.2                  (x-a)(x� + y�) + bx + cy = 0.

In fact,        using this canonical form, Van Rees proved several interesting
properties of these cubics.
For the sake of completeness we give here all the proofs, using our method.
Brocard, Chasles, Dandelin, Darboux, Salmon and Teixeira  are among the people
who studied these curves.
References to the older literature may be found in the "Bibliography" at the
end of these notes.
1.3   The main result on these cubics may be considered to be Theorem 4.6
(Van Rees) below.
A glance at the initial proof of this theorem, as well as the proofs of
other properties, disperced in the above-mentioned literature, convinces
of the lack of a unifying concept, relating algebraic to metric properties
of these curves.

1.4   By our approach to the problem, which is fairly elementary, we try to
show that the unifying concept, which allows a systematic discussion of the
properties of these curves, is the group structure defined on a cubic,
discovered by Jacobi  in 1835 (Fulton , Walker , Van der Waerden [8],
Brieskorn, Knoerrer [9]).

This group structure and Bezout's theorem are the only tools from algebraic
geometry needed for our purpose.  They are briefly discussed in 3. In 2.
we derive the equations of the cubics, make some trivial remarks and give
the pictures of the locus for some special positions of the points A, B, C
and D.  In 4. we prove the main properties of the Apollonian cubics.  In 5.
we discuss the cases in which one of the two cubics has a double point and
in 6. we discuss the cases in which one of the cubics is reducible to a conic
and a line.  The Apollonian circle of two segments, together with the
supporting line of the segments, gives a special case of such a reducible
cubic (figure-1) . In 7. we discuss metric properties of the cubics and in 8.
we examine a group generated by inversions, which leaves the Apollonian (or
isoptic) cubic invariant.

2.    The equations

2.1  We identify the plane with �� and represent with the same letters the
coordinates of points A=(a1, a2), B=(b1, b2) etc.   We denote also by <X,Y>
the usual inner product:
<X,Y> = x1y1 + x2y2 .

2.2   The locus of points viewing the segment AB under the angle f, consists
of two circles, desribed by the equations:
             <X,X> - <X, (A+B)> + <A, B> =  �cotf(<X, J(B-A)> - <A, JB>).
                        (*)
J denotes the +90�-rotation of ��, described in coordinates:

(x,y) |--> (-y, x).
The sign � corresponds to the two sides of the segment AB (segments and
circles are supposed to be oriented).
Analogous equations will describe the locus of points viewing CD under
the angle f :
            <X,X> - <X, (C+D)> + <C, D> =  �cotf(<X, J(D-C)> - <C, JD>).
