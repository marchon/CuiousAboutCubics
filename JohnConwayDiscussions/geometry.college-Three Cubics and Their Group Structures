This summer I spent several days at Princeton talking Geometry with John 
Conway. We spent much of the time talking about cubics and geometry. The 
following is from my notes. I plan to follow this with a page on how the 
group law is established. I have pictures of all three for anyone who is 
interested. Those who have gotten the others will get the third so you do 
not have to ask.

There have been recent messages about the isotomic cubic with pivot K+, 
the superior of the symmedian point, also the isotomic conjugate of the 
orthocenter H. We have also spoken of the Antipodal cubic, an isogonal 
cubic with pivot L, the deLongchamps point. Note both pivots are strong 
points.

There is a third cubic related to these: the isogonal cubic with pivot G, 
the centroid. Kimberline introduces his section on cubics with this one.

These cubics are related; there is an isomorphism between the group laws 
of these cubics.

It is these group laws which give these cubics added structural 
importance in geometry (compared to, say, conics). They define 
colinearities between quartiles of points. The articles and books that 
mention these cubics give their names and the important points on the 
cubic. In doing this they miss their significance. They also ignore the 
quartile nature of the structures. It is not the points that matter as 
much as the lines between the points.

The three cubics may be defined together. 

The set of points P for which there exists points Q,R such that the pedal 
of P is the cevian of Q and the prepedal of P is the precevian of R.

The points P lie on the antipodal cubic.
The points Q lie on the K+ isotomic cubic.
The points R lie on the G isogonal cubic.

Each cubic has a group of the form   Z cross V, where Z is the integers 
and V is the Viergruppe, the Klein 4 group.


Group tables
If spaces are left blank it is because the points are not named points.
Not all named points have been listed on each cubic; eg, L is at row -IV 
on the isotomic cubic.

In the group table the rows represent the integers, denoted by Roman 
numerals.  The o a b c represent the 4 elements of the 4-group. These 
symbols obey
o+a=a, o+b=b, o+c=c, o+o=o       a+b=c, a+c=b, b+c=a.

Points come in groups of 4.

Rows of weak and strong points alternate, guaranteeing that families of 
weak lines will be concur at strong points.

Here the Gx (x=o,a,b,c) are the Gergonnes, Nx the Nagels, Mx the 
Mitten(punkt)s, Ix the incenters, the + is the superior operation, the - 
the subordinate, ~ represents reflection accross the circumcenter O, * 
represents isogonal conjugate. AL...are the feet of the cevian triangle 
of L, AK+ ... are the feet of the cevian triangle of K+

The points at infinity are those on the perpendicular bisectors of the 
sides of ABC.

constant   O                      O                      K+

The right table (the isotomic cubic) is the superior of the left, 
staggered by two rows.


Implementing the group tables.

Three points that obey the group relations are colinear. To obey those 
relations the integers on the left must add to the constant and the oabc 
must satisfy the relations given above.

Example:

For the isotomic cubic the constant is K+ with Z value -II. These sets of 
points are colinear

      points             Z values          4-group values
      
      G A+ A             0  0  -II         o  o  a
      G G K+             0  0  -II         o  o  o
      Ga Na K+           I -I  -II         a  a  o
      AB+ B K+           II  -Ii  -II      b  b  o
      
Points in rows above and below the Ix are isogonally conjugate.
Points in rows above and below the G row are isotomically conjugate.
Points above and below the O row are reflections accross the circumcenter 
O.

If X, Y, Z are colinear then

X  X+A  X+B  X+C
Y  Y+A  Y+B  Y+C
Z  Z+A  Z+B  Z+C

form a desmic triple of quadrangles. Hence there are lots of them.

If particular importance are the tangents to the cubic at important 
points but that will have to wait til next time.
